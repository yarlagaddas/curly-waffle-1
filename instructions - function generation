Excellent question — this is where your setup really starts to shine 💪

Because your copilot-instructions.md already defines coding standards, you can now ask very naturally for new functionality — and Copilot will create production-ready code that follows your conventions (TypeScript, Angular 19, OnPush, Jest tests, etc.).

🧠 What to Ask (Plain English Prompt)

Here are a few natural ways to phrase it inside Copilot Chat (any of these work):

Add a function in this component that converts a UTC date string to the user’s local timezone.

Include validation for invalid dates and format it as MM/dd/yyyy, HH:mm.

Or a bit shorter:

Add a UTC-to-local timezone converter function inside this component, with proper error handling.

Or if you want to explicitly include comments:

Add a UTC-to-local timezone conversion function to this component with inline comments explaining each step.

⸻

⚙️ Expected Behavior (based on your instruction file)

Copilot will:
	•	Insert the new function within your component’s TypeScript file.
	•	Follow Angular + TypeScript best practices (no inline logic in the template).
	•	Use Date and Intl.DateTimeFormat or toLocaleString() for conversion.
	•	Handle invalid dates gracefully (no runtime errors).
	•	Optionally add Jest test stubs to your .spec.ts file.
	•	Respect your formatting — OnPush, SCSS, Jest, etc.

If you specify “with inline comments,” it will generate something like:

convertUtcToLocal(utcDateString: string): string {
  try {
    // Parse the input string as UTC
    const utcDate = new Date(utcDateString);

    // If the date is invalid, return a fallback
    if (isNaN(utcDate.getTime())) {
      return 'Invalid Date';
    }

    // Convert to local time using the browser’s locale
    return utcDate.toLocaleString(undefined, {
      year: 'numeric',
      month: '2-digit',
      day: '2-digit',
      hour: '2-digit',
      minute: '2-digit',
    });
  } catch (err) {
    // Log or handle the exception gracefully
    console.error('Error converting UTC date:', err);
    return 'Error';
  }
}


⸻

🧩 Bonus — Add to Testing

After Copilot adds the function, you can immediately ask:

Add Jest test cases for the UTC-to-local conversion function covering valid and invalid inputs.

That’ll extend your .spec.ts with unit tests like:
	•	valid date → returns local formatted string
	•	invalid date → returns “Invalid Date”
	•	empty input → handles gracefully

💬 Tip for Comment Style

If you want Copilot to always include meaningful inline comments (not just when you ask),
you can add this one-liner at the end of your copilot-instructions.md file:

## 10) Commenting rule
Every generated function, service, or component should include short inline comments explaining key logic and purpose.

Then you’ll never have to say “with comments” again — it’ll be automatic 🧠
