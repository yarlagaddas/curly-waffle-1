Perfect 👍 — here’s a short starter checklist and a few first test prompts you can use to confirm that Copilot is correctly reading and applying your copilot-instructions.md file.

⸻

✅ Initial Test Setup Checklist

Before testing:
	1.	Make sure copilot-instructions.md is in the root of your repo (same level as package.json or inside your workspace root).
	2.	Confirm it includes your repository path rules (projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/...).
	3.	Restart VS Code (so Copilot reloads the context).
	4.	Open the Copilot Chat panel — and ensure you’re in the same workspace.
	5.	Start with short, natural prompts to see if Copilot creates the correct files in the right folder.

💬 Test 1: Simple Component

Prompt:

Create a component with a button that shows a message when clicked.

Expected behavior:
	•	Creates all 4 files (.ts, .html, .scss, .spec.ts)
	•	Uses standalone syntax and OnPush
	•	Adds a Material button
	•	Uses MatSnackBar or similar for showing a message
	•	Puts everything under
projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/components/

⸻

💬 Test 2: Component with Input Fields

Prompt:

Create a component with two input fields and a submit button. When I click submit, show a dialog saying “Submitted successfully.”

Expected behavior:
	•	Generates both a component and a dialog component
	•	Automatically uses MatDialog and MatDialogRef
	•	Includes proper imports, isLoading, OnPush
	•	Adds Jest test files for both (creation + dialog open/close)
	•	Dialog should be accessible (ariaLabel, role="dialog")

⸻

💬 Test 3: Shared Reusable Component

Prompt:

Create a reusable form input component that can be used in multiple screens.

Expected behavior:
	•	Puts files under components/shared/
	•	Adds @Input() and @Output()
	•	Exports the component in public-api.ts

⸻

💬 Test 4: Service Creation

Prompt:

Create a service that fetches form details from /api/forms.

Expected behavior:
	•	Adds a file under services/
	•	Uses HttpClient with typed model from models/
	•	Adds catchError and logs via MatSnackBar or a shared alert
	•	Generates a Jest test file using HttpTestingController

⸻

💬 Test 5: Review an Existing Component

Prompt:

Review this component for SWFT standards and tell me what is missing.

Expected behavior:
	•	Checks for missing things like OnPush, SubSink, isLoading, @Input(), test coverage, etc.
	•	Gives precise suggestions (no generic feedback).

⸻

💬 Test 6: Add Tests

Prompt:

Add Jest test cases for this component covering success and error paths.

Expected behavior:
	•	Updates or creates the .spec.ts file
	•	Uses TestBed and ComponentFixture
	•	Adds test for isLoading or failure case
	•	Mocks dialogs or services if present

⸻

💬 Test 7: Fix Placement Check

Prompt:

Create a component with a button and place it in the shared folder.

Expected behavior:
	•	All files appear in
projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/components/shared/
	•	Not in a duplicate or top-level folder.

Once these pass, you’re 100% production-ready.
After that, you can just talk naturally, like:

“Add loading and error handling for this API call.”
“Convert this to follow our standards.”
“Create a simple dialog for confirmation.”

Copilot will automatically follow your instruction file for everything.
