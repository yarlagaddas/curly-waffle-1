Perfect — you’re absolutely on the right track 👏

Once your copilot-instructions.md is complete (like yours is), you no longer need to “teach” Copilot in your prompt.
You just talk like a person, and it should already apply all the SWFT rules automatically (4 files, OnPush, Jest, SubSink, correct folder, etc.).

Here’s how your earlier technical prompts translate into plain English Copilot chat that’ll still produce full, production-ready code:

⸻

🧩 Component creation

✅ Instead of

Create a SWFT Angular component with two inputs and a button. Generate .ts, .html, .scss, and .spec.ts.

Just say

Create a component with two input fields and a button in the middle.

⸻

✅ Instead of

Create a reusable shared component under components/shared/.

Just say

Create a reusable component that can be used in other screens.

⸻

✅ Instead of

Create a dialog component with MAT_DIALOG_DATA and MatDialogRef.

Just say

When I click the button, open a dialog box with a message and a confirm button.

⸻

✅ Instead of

Add an isLoading flag, handle errors with MatSnackBar, and use OnPush.

Just say

Add proper loading and error handling the way we usually do in this project.

⸻

✅ Instead of

Generate four files (.ts, .html, .scss, .spec.ts).

Just say

Create a new component.

(it will automatically create all four files because that’s in your instructions)

⸻

🧰 Services and models

✅ Instead of

Create a service with HttpClient, typed model, and Jest tests.

Just say

Create a service that fetches form data from /api/forms.

⸻

✅ Instead of

Add a model under models/.

Just say

Add a data model for the form with id, name, and status.

⸻

🧪 Tests

✅ Instead of

Generate Jest unit tests.

Just say

Write tests for this component.

or

Add test cases for success, error, and output.

⸻

🔁 Updates / Refactors

✅ Instead of

Convert this to standalone and OnPush.

Just say

Make this follow our component standards.

⸻

✅ Instead of

Add @Input and @Output.

Just say

Allow this component to accept data and send back an event when clicked.

⸻

🧱 Path placement

✅ Instead of

Put in components/shared/.

Just say

This should be reusable — put it in shared.

or if not:

Create it in the components folder.

⸻

🧩 Review and checks

✅ Instead of

Review this for OnPush, Jest, SCSS…

Just say

Review this component for SWFT standards.

⸻

In short, you can now talk to Copilot the way you’d talk to a teammate.
You don’t have to mention files, extensions, folders, or frameworks — your instruction file already enforces that.

⸻

💡 Example full conversation that should just work now:

You:

Create a component with two textboxes and a button.
When I click the button, show a dialog saying “Submitted successfully.”

Copilot:
➡️ Creates a component under components/
➡️ Uses standalone, OnPush
➡️ Adds isLoading, SubSink, SCSS
➡️ Creates the dialog component
➡️ Generates .spec.ts files for both
➡️ Adds tests for open/close and click flow

All from two normal English sentences — no need to mention file types or paths.
