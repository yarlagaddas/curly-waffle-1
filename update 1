Reusability principle:  
`swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared` is one of multiple Angular libraries used in the SWFT ecosystem.  
Each library is responsible for a specific functional area and exposes reusable components, services, and models through its `public-api.ts`.  
Within this library, the `shared/` folder is used to group components that are reused across multiple features **inside** the same library.  
Any component, service, or model intended for reuse across other SWFT libraries or UI applications must be properly exported in `public-api.ts`.


Reusability principle:  
This library (`swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared`) contains reusable components, services, and models used by SWFT UI applications.  
The `shared/` folder inside this library is used only for components reused within this same library and does not apply across other SWFT libraries.  
Any component, service, or model intended for use outside this library must be exported through `public-api.ts`.


Reusability principle:  
This library (`swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared`) contains reusable components, services, and models that can be used across multiple SWFT UI repositories.  
The `shared/` folder is used to organize these common components.  
All reusable items must be properly exported through `public-api.ts`.
