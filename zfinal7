## Repository and Path Rule

All code generation must happen **inside the current open workspace and repository** where this instruction file exists.  
Do **not** create new folders at the root or outside this workspace.

The main Angular library for this project is: SWFT_NGX_EFORM_TRIGGER_SHARED/projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/

When generating any files, always treat this path as the base.

### Default folder placement rules

If no folder is specified, automatically use the correct one based on the artifact type:

| Artifact Type | Default Folder (relative to base path) |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Component / Dialog | components/ |
| Shared / Reusable Component | components/shared/ |
| Service | services/ |
| Model / DTO | models/ |
| Constant | constants/ |
| Enum | enums/ |
| Directive | directives/ |

### Additional Rules
- Never place files directly under `swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/` (the library root).  
- Never create new folders at the root level (for example another `swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/`).  
- Resolve all relative paths starting from the base library path above.  
- Always use existing folder names unless the user explicitly requests a new subfolder.
