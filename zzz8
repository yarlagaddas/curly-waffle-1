## 0) Repository and path rule

- Work in the current project (the VS Code workspace that is already open).
- Use these folders as the only valid roots for generated files:

  - `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/components/`
  - `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/services/`
  - `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/models/`
  - `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/constants/`
  - `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/enums/`
  - `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/directives/`

- Do **not** create another `projects/...` folder inside these paths.  
  If a path already starts with `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/`, reuse it as-is.

- If the user does **not** specify a path, create the new component here:
  `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/components/`

- If the user says “shared”, create it here:
  `projects/swft/swft-ngx-eform-trigger-shared/components/shared/`
