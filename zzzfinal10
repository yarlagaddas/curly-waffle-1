## 10) Commenting and Documentation Standards

- All generated code must include short, meaningful comments that explain purpose and intent.  
- Add a brief JSDoc comment (`/** ... */`) above every class, function, or service method summarizing what it does.  
- Use inline comments (`// ...`) only where logic or reasoning is not obvious.  
- Comments should describe *why* the code exists or *what it achieves*, not restate syntax.  
- Test files should include concise comments describing each scenario or test case.  
- Keep comments professional, consistent, and aligned with enterprise code review standards.  
- Every generated artifact must be self-explanatory and production-ready.
